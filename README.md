## üìù To-Do App

A simple and interactive **To-Do application** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project demonstrates CRUD operations and helps users manage their tasks efficiently.

## üìë Dynamic Tabs JS Project

An interactive **Tabs interface** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates how to create dynamic tabs and manage content switching using vanilla JavaScript.

### Features
- **Dynamic Tab Generation:** Tabs are created dynamically from a JavaScript array.
- **Content Switching:** Displays the corresponding content when a tab is clicked.
- **Active Tab Highlighting:** The currently selected tab is highlighted for better user experience.
- **Simple & Clean UI:** Easy-to-use and visually clean interface.
- **Responsive Design:** Works well on different screen sizes.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML** ‚Äì Structure of the tabs and content.
- **CSS** ‚Äì Styling for tabs, content, and active states.
- **JavaScript** ‚Äì Logic for dynamic rendering and tab switching.

### How It Works
1. A JavaScript array (`tabsData`) contains the details for each tab (id, title, content).  
2. Tabs and their content are dynamically generated on page load.  
3. Clicking a tab highlights it and shows the corresponding content while hiding others.  
4. The first tab is active by default when the page loads.
